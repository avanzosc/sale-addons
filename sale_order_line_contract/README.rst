Sale order line contract
========================

* In products new fields "Recurrence", and "Invoice Every".
* When a sales order is confirmed, a contract line will be created, if this is
  defined in the product.
* If there is an active contract for the customer, that contract will be used,
  if there is no active contract for the customer, a new one will be created.
